# Mobile/base protocol architecture

## Layer 1

 - modulation/demodulation
 - transmitter/receiver switching
 
 - frequency(or channel) setting
 - RSSI(outputs Radio-Signal-strength-Indicator
 
 - frequency correction 
 - power control
 - broadcast parameters related to power control part of the MAC

 - symbol synchronization

 - receiving/submitting data from and to the MAC
 - slot flag coding/de-coding using two distinct training sequences 
 - scrambling/de-scrambling
 
 ## Layer 2
	**Medium Access Control (MAC) **
	
	- channel coding
	-
